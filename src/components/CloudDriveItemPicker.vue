/****
 * A generic picker for Cloud Drives (when a Drive-specific API cannot be used).
 * The picker is a minimal file/folder explorer, configurable.
 * To make things easier we use a shared item model that each Drive needs to match
 * when providing the Drive's content. 
 * We expect the interaction between the picker navigation and the Drive queries to 
 * be continuous: it's unlikely a Drive query returns ALL elements in one go, so when
 * we need to get a folder content (on expanding the folder) then we need to get receive
 * another data content from the Drive... (it is not ideal, but it avoid waiting for
 * fetching the whole data if the Drive doesn't provide that in one go...)
 * However, we do so only when we have never looked for the content, so if the Drive
 * content has changed in the meantime, it won't be seen.
